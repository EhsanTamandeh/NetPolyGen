# Introduction

PolyGenNet- is a computational framework designed to analyze and visualize gene interaction networks in the context of complex human traits. The platform integrates multiple datasets to uncover trait-specific variations in gene interactions and provides an accessible interface for both exploratory analysis and hypothesis-driven research.
